Chapter 3 OVERVIEW
3.1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to describe the functional requirements applicable to the Tempo IXL in the context of the Project Execution.

3.2. Scope
This document presents the functional requirements applicable to the TELP CBI for baseline 1.
These requirements specify the expected behaviour of the applicative software of the IXL (Business Logic). This applicative software uses services provided by the vital platform. In this document, hypotheses are taken on the vital platform services.

3.3. Limitation
Some functions are not described in this document because they are not in the scope of Baseline 1. These functions will be described during the following baselines in a manner to fully comply with the DCPS.
Baseline1 scope is limited to the generic Tempo solution with the following adaptation:
-	Field equipment management: Switches, Signals, Track Circuits, Emergency Buttons
In particular, the following functions are managed
-	Protect a zone following Staff Protection Keyswitch (SPKS) activation
-	Protect a zone following Emergency Stop Plunger (ESP) activation
-	Protect a zone following Emergency Stop Switch (ESS) activation
-	Prevent trains' collision with unlocked Blast Doors.

Applicable messaging is assumed to be the generic messaging. 

3.4. Target Audience
Target audience of this document is the GE T252 project team (System, I&V, safety).



Chapter 4 METHODOLOGY
4.1. Requirement Allocation methodology
#mrSectionBegin includes\include0.docx

          
 IXL_6269 RequirementManagement_D_01
The IXL equipment is composed of a vital platform and a business logic.
Functional requirements are allocated to IXL equipment if they involve both the Business Logic and the Vital platform. These are typically requirements related to performance where the overall performance needs to be tested.
Otherwise, they are allocated to the business logic only. 
 
 IXL_6270 RequirementManagement_D_02
The design of the Interlocking Business Logic is done taking some hypothesis on the vital platform.
These hypotheses are allocated to the Vital platform. 
 
 IXL_6271 RequirementManagement_D_03
The design of the Interlocking equipment is done taking some hypothesis on external equipment / actors.
These hypotheses are allocated to the relevant equipment / Actor

The route body TVDs are all the TVDs along the path of the route starting from the 1st TVD downstream of the Home Signal of the route until the destination TVD (included). 
 
 IXL_19 RouteTVDs_D_02
The Overlap TVDs are all the TVDs along the path of the overlap of the route starting with the 1st TVD downstream of the destination TVD.  
 
 IXL_394 RouteTVDs_D_03
The transit zone of a route is a zone containing TVDs that have to be free for the interlocking to allow to set a route or to move a switch of this zone.
It includes all the TVDs from the 1st TVD of the route to the autorelease TVD. 
 
 IXL_146 RouteTVDs_D_04
When a TVD is not in the direct line of a signal route but one of its extremities is not at the required clearance point for that route, then the TVD is defined as foul of the route.   
 
 IXL_2092 RouteTVDs_D_05
The transit TVD is the last TVD off the transit zone. 
 
 IXL_3528 RouteTVDs_D_06

 IXL_95 RequestSignalAspect_D_01
A signal aspect corresponds to a combination of lights that give information to the train driver.
Signal aspects are generally divided between the "Restrictive" Aspect, and the "Permissive" aspects 
 
 IXL_TEL_156 RequestSignalAspect_D_02
The signal aspects controlled by the IXL are:
- Proceed
- At Danger 
 
 IXL_106 RequestSignalAspect_D_03
A signal is said to be restrictive when the aspect it displays does not allow the train to pass.  
 
 IXL_107 RequestSignalAspect_D_04
A signal is said to be permissive when the aspect it displays allows the train to pass at maximum or reduced speed 
 
 IXL_113 RequestSignalAspect_D_05
'To clear a signal' means change a Signal Aspect from its most restrictive aspect to a less restrictive aspect. 
 
 IXL_1949 RequestSignalAspect_D_06
The signal requested aspect corresponds to the aspect that the IXL should display on field according to the signalling conditions.

 IXL_85 OverlapDescription_D_01
An overlap is the track section or sections downstream of the destination signal of a route which is locked and proved free in the conditions to set a route. 
 
 IXL_2051 OverlapDescription_D_02
The primary overlap is the preferred one. It will be the one set if all its associated switches are free to move. 
 
 IXL_2052 OverlapDescription_D_03
The secondary overlaps are the overlaps associated to a route, other than the primary overlap. 
 
 IXL_2053 OverlapDescription_D_04
A swinging overlap is an overlap that can be changed if a route requesting the switches in a different position is set. 
 
 IXL_86 OverlapDescription_D_05
The overlap strike-in TVD is the TVD that locks the swinging overlap when occupied. 
 
 IXL_2054 OverlapDescription_D_06
The berth track is the portion of track immediately on the approach to a signal. Depending on the maximum train length and length of the TVDs several TVDs can be part of the berth track.

 IXL_332 IXL_RelayInterface_R_01
The IXL shall not be affected by relays rebounds. 

IOC shall filter inputs for transitory state changes for 100ms.
As example, for NS1 relay based field interface, anti-bounce filter shall be configured to satisfy: 

•Energized state (15 V < Ue < 35 V) :
-Must be taken into account if present for more than 200 ms,
-Must not be taken into account if present for less than 20 ms.
•De-energized state (0 V < Ue < 10 V) :
-Must be taken into account if present for more than 100 ms,
-Must not be taken into account if present for less than 20 ms.

An additional applicative filtering timer can be applied when necessary to some elements (switch position status or track circuit). This timer is optional and can be set at different values for each field element.
