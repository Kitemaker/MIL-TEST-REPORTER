Table 3: Delta definitions
TermDescriptionRouteA route is a path along a section of a track between two signals or one signal and one destination TVD. SwitchSwitches are movable, tapered blades of metal for setting alternative routes of running rail.
Each of such blades is pivoted at the heel, its toe being locked against the stock rail when in the closed position.
Facing switches if the train approaches the toe, trailing switches if the train approaches the heel. SubrouteA subroute is used to lock a switch when a route or an overlap is set or during the sectional release of the route.Traffic LockingThe traffic locking represents the locking of a direction on a traffic section by the route logic. It is a condition to authorize the route.Traffic DirectionThe traffic direction represents the authorization given by the IXL to the ATC to travel a traffic section in a given direction.Track Detection DeviceA track vacancy detector (TVD) is any device provided to prove the presence or
absence of trains on a block.DirectionThe direction UP/DOWN is arbitrary decided for each portion of the trackOverlapAn overlap is the track section or sections downstream of the destination signal of a route which is locked and proved free in the conditions to set a routeApproach LockingThe approach locking prevents the immediate release of a route when an approaching train may be unable to stop.CycleA cycle is a sequence of several routes triggered by the system on the basis of TVD occupancy (and treadles' status if any). A cycle is generally used to perform a turnback operation.

Chapter 3 OVERVIEW
This document presents the functional requirements applicable to the IXL Baseline 3.1 UT.
It refines the Urban system requirements allocated to the Interlocking.
This document lists the requirements organized in Architecture, Functional, Constraint, Interface and Performance sections. 



Chapter 4 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
4.1. Requirement Allocation methodology
 IXL_6269 RequirementManagement_D_01
The IXL equipment is composed of a vital platform and a business logic.
Functional requirements are allocated to IXL equipment if they involve both the Business Logic and the Vital platform. These are typically requirements related to performance where the overall performance needs to be tested.
Otherwise, they are allocated to the business logic only.
 IXL_6270 RequirementManagement_D_02
The design of the Interlocking Business Logic is done taking some hypothesis on the vital platform.
These hypotheses are allocated to the Vital platform.
 IXL_6271 RequirementManagement_D_03
The design of the Interlocking equipment is done taking some hypothesis on external equipment / actors.
These hypotheses are allocated to the relevant equipment / Actor

Figure 1: AllocationMethodology
4.2. Terminology
 IXL_383 Control
A "Control" is an action which is operated by the Signaller to set switches and routes, Clear and replace Signals and operate other Signalling Functions.
 IXL_333 Interlocking
"Interlocking" is a general term applied to the equipment which safely performs the setting and releasing of signals and switches to prevent unsafe conditions arising.
 IXL_334 Locked
"Locked" is the state of any Signalling Function or item of equipment when it is conditionally or unconditionally prevented from changing state or position by other parts of the Signalling System.
 IXL_335 Release
Release is the removal of Locking on a function, for example, the removal of Route Locking or the unlocking of a function such as a Ground Frame.
 IXL_384 Status
"Status" is the state of any signalling function or equipment provided to the operator for monitoring
4.3. Manage Route
4.3.1. Purpose
The purpose of this section is to describe the life cycle of a route, the conditions to set it, release it or block it.
4.3.2. Route Definitions
4.3.2.1. Route Description
Principles and Definitions
 IXL_7 RouteDescription_D_01
A route is a path along a section of track between one signal and one destination TVD.

Figure 2: Route Definition
 IXL_6 RouteDescription_D_02
The starting point of a route is always a signal called the Home Signal of the route.
 IXL_338 RouteDescription_D_03
A route destination signal is the signal, if any, positioned at the level (usually the end) of the destination TVD.
 IXL_962 RouteDescription_D_04
A straight route is a route passing only through switches in normal position (or without switches).
A deviated route is a route passing through at least one switch in reverse position

External Hypothesis
 IXL_936 RouteDescription_H_01
The topological definition of a route shall include the home signal, the destination TVD and the path of the route in case of possibility of alternative path between entry and exit of the route.
Safety related: Yes
Satisfied by:  TempoTools -
 IXL_937 RouteDescription_H_02
The destination of the route shall be the last TVD of the route body.
Safety related: Yes
Satisfied by:  TempoTools -
 IXL_1881 RouteDescription_H_03
The definition of a route shall include the associated overlaps. There can either be no overlap, only one overlap or several overlaps associated to a route. When several overlaps are available, one of them can be marked as primary overlap, the other overlaps being necessarily secondary overlaps. It is also possible to define all the overlaps as secondary. 
Data model:
Route.PrimaryOverlap[0..1]
Route.SecondaryOverlap[0..*]
Safety related: Yes
Satisfied by:  TempoTools -
4.3.2.2. Route Switches
Principles and Definitions
 IXL_18 RouteSwitches_D_01
A switch is said to be requested by a route when it is necessary for the route to have this switch in a defined position. The switch may be part of the route or part of the overlap or a flank protection switch
 IXL_136 RouteSwitches_D_02
A flank switch is a switch which, if traversed by an overrunning train in the facing direction, could direct that train towards a route or overlap that has been set for an authorized train movement.
 IXL_14 RouteSwitches_D_03
The route body switches are all the switches belonging to the route body TVDs
 IXL_15 RouteSwitches_D_04
The route body flank protection switches are all the switches requested as protection for the route body
 IXL_16 RouteSwitches_D_05
The route overlap switches are all the switches belonging to the route overlap.
 IXL_17 RouteSwitches_D_06
The route overlap flank protection switches are all the switches requested as protection for the route overlap
 IXL_6205 RouteSwitches_D_07
Foul protection switches are all the switches requested as protection of fouling point.

External Hypothesis
 IXL_986 RouteSwitches_R_01
The definition of a route shall include the position of all the switches, Power Operated or unworked, including flank protection.
Safety related: Yes

Derived from:  9 =Functional_IXL_17
Satisfied by:  TempoTools -
4.3.2.3. Route TVDs
Principles and Definitions
 IXL_20 RouteTVDs_D_01
The route body TVDs are all the TVDs along the path of the route starting from the 1st TVD downstream of the Home Signal of the route until the destination TVD (included).
 IXL_19 RouteTVDs_D_02
The Overlap TVDs are all the TVDs along the path of the overlap of the route starting with the 1st TVD downstream of the destination TVD.
 IXL_394 RouteTVDs_D_03
The transit zone of a route is a zone containing TVDs that have to be free for the interlocking to allow to set a route or to move a switch of this zone.
It includes all the TVDs from the 1st TVD of the route to the autorelease TVD.
 IXL_146 RouteTVDs_D_04
When a TVD is not in the direct line of a signal route but one of its extremities is not at the required clearance point for that route, then the TVD is defined as foul of the route.
 IXL_2092 RouteTVDs_D_05
The transit TVD is the last TVD off the transit zone.
 IXL_3528 RouteTVDs_D_06
The autorelease TVD is the 1st TVD to occupy to initiate the autorelease sequence.
In case of a sequence involving 2 TVDs, the autorelease TVD is the transit TVD.
4.3.2.4. Route Direction
Principles and Definitions
 IXL_8 RouteDirection_D_01
The direction of the route is arbitrarily assigned in UP or in DOWN direction for each traffic section during engineering phase.
External Hypothesis
 IXL_1565 RouteDirection_R_01
The definition of a route shall include for each TVD of the route body and route overlap the traveled direction: UP or DOWN.
Safety related: Yes
Derived from:  9 =Functional_IXL_17
Satisfied by:  TempoTools -

4.3.2.5. Route Class
Principles and Definitions
 IXL_1882 RouteClass_D_01
A route class is a category of route which determines the type of Signal controls to be provided. The possible route classes are Main or Shunt.
 IXL_1883 RouteClass_D_02
A shunt class route is a route used for low-speed non-passenger movements.
 IXL_1886 RouteClass_D_03
A main class route is a route from one Main Signal to the next that allows Running Movements. It requires the section and Overlap to be clear.
External Hypothesis
 IXL_1888 RouteClass_H_01
The data preparation shall define the class of each route: Main or Shunt.
Safety related: Yes
Satisfied by:  TempoTools -
 IXL_2102 RouteClass_H_02
For shunting routes, the data preparation shall define the ShuntingTVD and the MinShuntingTVDOccupiedDelay. This delay can be null, meaning that there is no minimum delay.
Data model:
- Route.ShuntingTVD[0..1]
- Route.MinShuntingTVDOccupiedDelay
Safety related: Yes
Satisfied by:  TempoTools -
4.3.2.6. Conflicting Routes
Principles and Definitions
 IXL_1 ConflictingRoutes_D_01
Two Routes are said to be conflicting by switch position if:
-They share at least one switch;
and
-This switch is requested in opposite position by each route individually

Figure 3: Route Conflicting by Switch Position
 IXL_2 ConflictingRoutes_D_02
Two Routes are said to be conflicting by traffic direction if:
- they possess at least one common TVD and travel through it in opposite direction.

Figure 4: Routes conflicting by Traffic Direction
 IXL_3 ConflictingRoutes_D_03
Two routes are said to be conflicting for registering if one cannot be registered when the other one is set.
Conditions to declare 2 routes as conflicting for registering are project specific.

 IXL_4 ConflictingRoutes_D_04
Two routes are said to be conflicting for setting if they are neither conflicting by switch position nor by traffic direction but one cannot be set if the other one is already set.
For example, a main route cannot be set if it overlaps a shunting route which is set.

Figure 5: Routes conflicting for setting
 IXL_5 ConflictingRoutes_D_05
Two routes are defined as back to back if their home signals are located at the same position or at both ends of a set of TVDs but reading in opposite directions.

Figure 6: Back To Back routes
External Hypothesis
 IXL_1889 ConflictingRoutes_H_01
The data preparation shall define for each route the list of routes conflicting for registration, the routes conflicting for setting and the back to back routes.
Safety related: Yes
Satisfied by:  TempoTools -
4.3.2.7. Route Registrable
External Hypothesis
 IXL_1899 RouteRegistrable_H_01

4.4. Manage Switch
4.4.1. Purpose
The purpose of this function is to detect the position of the switch, to request its movement and to lock it.
4.4.2. Switch definitions
 IXL_94 SwitchDefinition_R_01
Switches are movable, tapered blades of metal for setting alternative routes of running rail.
Each of such blades is pivoted at the heel, its toe being locked against the stock rail when in the closed position.
Facing switches if the train approaches the toe, trailing switches if the train approaches the heel.

Figure 8: Switch Definition
 IXL_422 SwitchDefinition_R_02
Switch Machine is the equipment for the powered operation of a set of switches.
 IXL_421 SwitchDefinition_R_03
Switches are items of permanent way which may be aligned to one of two positions,
Normal or Reverse, according to the direction of train movement required.

Figure 9: Switch Position
 IXL_340 SwitchDefinition_R_04
The fouling point is the place where a vehicle standing on a converging line would come into contact with a vehicle on the other line.

Figure 10: Fouling point
 IXL_137 SwitchDefinition_R_05
Trap switch: Facing switches provided at an exit from a siding or converging line to derail an unauthorized movement, thus protecting movements on the adjacent running line.
 IXL_1923 SwitchDefinition_R_06
A switch is said to be free to move if no interlocking condition prevents its movement.
 IXL_1924 SwitchDefinition_R_07
Power Operated Switches are switches that are operated by any means apart from mechanical.
 IXL_1925 SwitchDefinition_R_08
Unworked switches are switches (usually Hand Switches) not controlled from the interlocking.
 IXL_1926 SwitchDefinition_R_09
Spring Switches are switches which return under spring load to the Normal position after the passage of a train in the Trailing Direction.
 IXL_1927 SwitchDefinition_R_10
Trailable switches are switch Machines made trailable so that a movement in the trailing direction with the switches set in the opposite position does not cause damage.
 IXL_1928 SwitchDefinition_R_11
The Normal position of switches is defined by the Signaling Plan. By convention, switches in the Normal position are set to give optimum protection to other Routes. The Normal position of a Crossover is to give parallel routes.
 IXL_1929 SwitchDefinition_R_12
The Reverse position of switches is the opposite position to Normal position
4.4.3. Detect Switch Position
Principles and Definitions
 IXL_135 DetectSwitchPosition_D_01
The switch detected position corresponds to the physical position and electrical check of the switch.
The possible positions are:
- Switch detected in Normal Position
- Switch detected in Reverse Position
- Switch not detected

4.5.6. Request signal aspect
Principles and Definitions
 IXL_95 RequestSignalAspect_D_01
A signal aspect corresponds to a combination of lights that give information to the train driver.
Signal aspects are generally divided between the "Restrictive" Aspect, and the "Permissive" aspects
 IXL_1838 RequestSignalAspect_D_02
The signal aspects controlled by the IXL are:
- Proceed
- Deviated_Track
- Override
- Limited_Speed
- Restrictive
- At Danger

 IXL_106 RequestSignalAspect_D_03
A signal is said to be restrictive when the aspect it displays does not allow the train to pass.
 IXL_107 RequestSignalAspect_D_04
A signal is said to be permissive when the aspect it displays allows the train to pass at maximum or reduced speed
 IXL_113 RequestSignalAspect_D_05
'To clear a signal' means change a Signal Aspect from its most restrictive aspect to a less restrictive aspect.

External Hypothesis
 IXL_3462 SignalApproachLocking_H_01
A theoretical approach distance upstream of a home signal is calculated based on the following:
 - maximum authorized speed for each type of train approaching the home signal and their breaking capability,
- the gradient of the track
- the train reaction time (driver reaction time + application of breaking for example)
- the technical delay necessary to take into account the TVD occupation. 
Safety related: Yes

The approach locking is the locking of any route from a signal, when the driver has seen or may have seen a Proceed Aspect at the Signal or has seen an Aspect at a previous Signal that would indicate to the driver that the former Signal is displaying a proceed aspect. If the Signal is replaced to danger, the approach locking prevents the immediate release of the route when an approaching train may be unable to stop.
 IXL_1988 ApproachLocking_D_02
The approach zone is the set of TVDs which are part of the approach locking.

Functional Requirements
 IXL_1990 SignalApproachLocking_R_02

4.12. Manage Overlap Locking
4.12.1. Overlap Description
Purpose
The purpose of the overlap locking is to lock the tracks and switches downstream of a destination signal in order to protect a train that would pass a restrictive signal or to allow a CBTC controlled train to approach a destination signal at optimum speed.

Principles and Definitions
 IXL_85 OverlapDescription_D_01
An overlap is the track section or sections downstream of the destination signal of a route which is locked and proved free in the conditions to set a route.
 IXL_2051 OverlapDescription_D_02
The primary overlap is the preferred one. It will be the one set if all its associated switches are free to move.
 IXL_2052 OverlapDescription_D_03
The secondary overlaps are the overlaps associated to a route, other than the primary overlap.
 IXL_2053 OverlapDescription_D_04
A swinging overlap is an overlap that can be changed if a route requesting the switches in a different position is set.
 IXL_86 OverlapDescription_D_05
The overlap strike-in TVD is the TVD that locks the swinging overlap when occupied.
 IXL_2054 OverlapDescription_D_06
The berth track is the portion of track immediately on the approach to a signal. Depending on the maximum train length and length of the TVDs several TVDs can be part of the berth track.

External Hypothesis
 IXL_2055 OverlapDescription_H_01
A theoretical overlap distance downstream of a destination signal shall be calculated based on the maximum authorized speed for a train approaching the destination signal and the gradient of the track. All blocks starting in this theoretical overlap distance shall be included in the overlap.
